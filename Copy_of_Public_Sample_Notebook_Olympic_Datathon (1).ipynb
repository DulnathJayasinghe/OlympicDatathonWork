Also, recording of Height and Weight may have been disproportionately lacking for events that are not explicitly dependent on height or weight classes. This has implications for analysing correlations between these physical attributes and performance. Events with height or weight classes should be less influenced by athletes heights and weights since they explicitly section off competition into classes of athletes competing only agaisnt other with similar heights or weights. But for events without these classes, each athlete's potential competitors have a much larger range of heights and weights and they thus may be significant factors in athletes' relative performance.\n",

(That is to say, a given athlete participating in a given event has an 85% chance of not winning a medal for it; it is important to keep in mind this is over all the recorded instances of participation, across all years and Games (ignoring potential missing records or errors etc) ).\n",

This is relevant because it tells us how informative winning or not winning a medal is, and alerts us to how small  a subsample anything analysing relative rates of winning gold vs silver vs bronze relies on.\n",
